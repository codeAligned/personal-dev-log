# Key-Value Cache for Search Engine
#
# Design a key-value cache to save the results of the most recent
# web server queries, including a snippet about the search results
# itself.

# In case youâ€™re not already familiar, a cache system is a widely
# adopted technique that is used in nearly every application today
# and applies to every layer of the technology stack. A cache
# system stores commonly used resources, for example in-memory,
# and the next time a request is made for the same resource,
# the system can return it immediately.

Part 1: User Cases and Constraints

1. user cases
  - user makes a cache hit with search query
  - user makes a cache miss with search query

2 constraints
  - traffic is not evenly distributed
  - cache needs to return results at a fast rate
  - cache resource is limited (stored in memory)
    - need to keep popular queries and eliminate non-popular ones
  - 10 million users / month
  - 10 billion queries / month
    - needs to store many queries inside the query

3. basic calculation behind the system to be built
    - query --> 50 bytes
    - snippets --> 2~3 kilobytes
    - total: ~2 to 3 kilobytes
    - 30 trillion bytes --> 30 TB of data /month
    - 4000 queries per second

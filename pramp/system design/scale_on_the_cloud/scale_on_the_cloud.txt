Scale on the Cloud
Many of todayâ€™s large scale concurrent systems rely on cloud computing platforms such as AWS or Google Cloud.

Describe how would you design a service using a common cloud computing platform such as AWS, to scale incrementally from supporting hundreds of users to millions of users.

For the purpose of the interview, assume the system generally receives user requests, does some processing, stores user data, and returns the results.

=======

Goal: design a cloud computing service like microsoft azure or amazon AWS that scales incrementally from supporting hundreds of users to millions of users

Focus on the part where the system receives user request, does some processing, stores user data, and returns the results

=======

Cloud computing
  - helps us to focus on software aspect instead of hardware
  - automatically scales based on needs
  - increases / decreases the cost based on needs

# ==============================================
Part 1: User Cases and Constraints
  - read and write a request to user data (for whatever app it may be)
  - cloud computing system must be flexible from dealing hundreds of users to millions of users

  constraints
    - has uneven distribution of traffic
    - 10 million clients
    - 100 billion read requests
    - 1 billion wrtie requests
      - edit/create of user data

    - 1 KB per write (roughly about a paragraph of data)

  back-to-envelope calculation
    - 1 000 byte * 1 billion = 1 trillion byte
      - 1TB of data per month
      - 12TB of data per Year
      - 48 TB of data in 4 years

    - ~40,000 read requests per second
    - 400 write requests per second
